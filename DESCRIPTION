Title: Quantifying (Animal) Sound Degradation  
Version: 2.1.3
Maintainer: Marcelo Araya-Salas <marcelo.araya@ucr.ac.cr>
Description: Intended to facilitate acoustic analysis of (animal) sound transmission experiments, which typically aim to quantify changes in signal structure when transmitted in a given habitat by broadcasting and re-recording animal sounds at increasing distances. The package offers a workflow with functions to prepare the data set for analysis as well as to calculate and visualize several degradation metrics, including blur ratio, signal-to-noise ratio, excess attenuation and envelope correlation among others (Dabelsteen et al 1993 <doi:10.1121/1.406682>).
